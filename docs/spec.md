# Dorian MVP Specification ‚Äì Developer-Ready

## Overview
**Dorian** is a wardrobe assistant that helps users manage their clothing and get outfit or packing recommendations via a web app. It leverages a hosted LLM to generate structured outfit suggestions based on the user's wardrobe and prompt input. This MVP focuses on a lightweight, flexible experience with room to grow.

## LLM Prompt Handling
- User input is natural language
- Backend enriches it using UI hints (occasion, weather, etc.)
- Formats structured prompt (e.g., LMQL or JSON outline)
- Response parsed and rendered as structured outfit

### Output Format (Outfit)

{
  "top": "black t-shirt",
  "bottom": "olive chinos",
  "shoes": "white sneakers",
  "outerwear": "grey hoodie",
  "accessories": "black cap"

## Error Handling Strategy
- Validate user input server-side
- Catch LLM API failures gracefully:
  - Show generic error message: ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt fetch a recommendation. Try again later.‚Äù
- Wardrobe checks before recommendations
- Fallback message for too-few items
- Track request errors in logs (CloudWatch)

---

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests
- Prompt formatter
- API handlers (add item, recommend, rate limit)
- DynamoDB access logic

### Integration Tests
- Full wardrobe ‚Üí outfit flow
- Rate-limited user path
- Feedback submission and logging

### Manual QA
- Add, view, and remove wardrobe items
- Send all 3 types of prompts
- Test with empty wardrobe
- Login/logout across multiple browsers

---

## Future Enhancements
- Autocomplete on add-item input
- Add photos, tags, and links to wardrobe items
- Smart wardrobe insights ("you don‚Äôt have anything for rain")
- Learning from feedback to tailor style
- Re-try recommendations with feedback loops
- Monetization via clothing suggestions and affiliate links

---

## Domain
- App hosted on: `https://dorian.app`

---

## Final Notes
- Start lean, focus on core loop (add item ‚Üí get outfit)
- Keep structured I/O from day one for future AI improvements
- All LLM-related data is stored for fine-tuning and analytics down the line
